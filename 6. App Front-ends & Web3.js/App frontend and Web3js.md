## Chapter 1: Intro to Web3.js

By completing Lesson 5, our zombie DApp is now complete. Now we're going to create a basic web page where your users can interact with it.

To do this, we're going to use a JavaScript library from the Ethereum Foundation called Web3.js.
What is Web3.js?

Remember, the Ethereum network is made up of nodes, with each containing a copy of the blockchain. When you want to call a function on a smart contract, you need to query one of these nodes and tell it:

    The address of the smart contract
    The function you want to call, and
    The variables you want to pass to that function.

Ethereum nodes only speak a language called JSON-RPC, which isn't very human-readable. A query to tell the node you want to call a function on a contract looks something like this:

// Yeah... Good luck writing all your function calls this way!
// Scroll right ==>
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendTransaction","params":[{"from":"0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155","to":"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567","gas":"0x76c0","gasPrice":"0x9184e72a000","value":"0x9184e72a","data":"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"}],"id":1}

Luckily, Web3.js hides these nasty queries below the surface, so you only need to interact with a convenient and easily readable JavaScript interface.

Instead of needing to construct the above query, calling a function in your code will look something like this:

CryptoZombies.methods.createRandomZombie("Vitalik Nakamoto ðŸ¤”")
  .send({ from: "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155", gas: "3000000" })

We'll explain the syntax in detail over the next few chapters, but first let's get your project set up with Web3.js.
Getting started

Depending on your project's workflow, you can add Web3.js to your project using most package tools:

// Using NPM
npm install web3

// Using Yarn
yarn add web3

// Using Bower
bower install web3

// ...etc.

Or you can simply download the minified .js file from github and include it in your project:

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="web3.min.js"></script>

Since we don't want to make too many assumptions about your development environment and what package manager you use, for this tutorial we're going to simply include Web3 in our project using a script tag as above.
Put it to the Test

We've created a shell of an HTML project file for you, index.html. Let's assume we have a copy of web3.min.js in the same folder as index.html.

    Go ahead and copy/paste the script tag above into our project so we can use web3.js



<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="web3.min.js"></script>


## Chapter 2: Web3 Providers

Great! Now that we have Web3.js in our project, let's get it initialized and talking to the blockchain.

The first thing we need is a Web3 Provider.

Remember, Ethereum is made up of nodes that all share a copy of the same data. Setting a Web3 Provider in Web3.js tells our code which node we should be talking to handle our reads and writes. It's kind of like setting the URL of the remote web server for your API calls in a traditional web app.

You could host your own Ethereum node as a provider. However, there's a third-party service that makes your life easier so you don't need to maintain your own Ethereum node in order to provide a DApp for your users â€” Infura.
Infura

Infura is a service that maintains a set of Ethereum nodes with a caching layer for fast reads, which you can access for free through their API. Using Infura as a provider, you can reliably send and receive messages to/from the Ethereum blockchain without needing to set up and maintain your own node.

You can set up Web3 to use Infura as your web3 provider as follows:

var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider("wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws"));

However, since our DApp is going to be used by many users â€” and these users are going to WRITE to the blockchain and not just read from it â€” we'll need a way for these users to sign transactions with their private key.

    Note: Ethereum (and blockchains in general) use a public / private key pair to digitally sign transactions. Think of it like an extremely secure password for a digital signature. That way if I change some data on the blockchain, I can prove via my public key that I was the one who signed it â€” but since no one knows my private key, no one can forge a transaction for me.

Cryptography is complicated, so unless you're a security expert and you really know what you're doing, it's probably not a good idea to try to manage users' private keys yourself in our app's front-end.

But luckily you don't need to â€” there are already services that handle this for you. The most popular of these is Metamask.
Metamask

Metamask is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users securely manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys, and use these accounts to interact with websites that are using Web3.js. (If you haven't used it before, you'll definitely want to go and install it â€” then your browser is Web3 enabled, and you can now interact with any website that communicates with the Ethereum blockchain!).

And as a developer, if you want users to interact with your DApp through a website in their web browser (like we're doing with our CryptoZombies game), you'll definitely want to make it Metamask-compatible.

    Note: Metamask uses Infura's servers under the hood as a web3 provider, just like we did above â€” but it also gives the user the option to choose their own web3 provider. So by using Metamask's web3 provider, you're giving the user a choice, and it's one less thing you have to worry about in your app.

Using Metamask's web3 provider

Metamask injects their web3 provider into the browser in the global JavaScript object web3. So your app can check to see if web3 exists, and if it does use web3.currentProvider as its provider.

Here's some template code provided by Metamask for how we can detect to see if the user has Metamask installed, and if not tell them they'll need to install it to use our app:

window.addEventListener('load', function() {

  // Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask)
  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider
    web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the user doesn't have web3. Probably
    // show them a message telling them to install Metamask in
    // order to use our app.
  }

  // Now you can start your app & access web3js freely:
  startApp()

})

You can use this boilerplate code in all the apps you create in order to require users to have Metamask to use your DApp.

    Note: There are other private key management programs your users might be using besides MetaMask, such as the web browser Mist. However, they all implement a common pattern of injecting the variable web3, so the method we describe here for detecting the user's web3 provider will work for these as well.



  Create some empty script tags before the closing </body> tag in our HTML file. We can write our javascript code for this lesson here.

    Go ahead and copy/paste the template code from above for detecting Metamask. It's the block that starts with window.addEventListener.

<script>
      
    </script>



    window.addEventListener('load', function() {

  // Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask)
  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider
    web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the user doesn't have web3. Probably
    // show them a message telling them to install Metamask in
    // order to use our app.
  }

  // Now you can start your app & access web3js freely:
  startApp()

})



## Chapter 3: Talking to Contracts

Now that we've initialized Web3.js with MetaMask's Web3 provider, let's set it up to talk to our smart contract.

Web3.js will need 2 things to talk to your contract: its address and its ABI.
Contract Address

After you finish writing your smart contract, you will compile it and deploy it to Ethereum. We're going to cover deployment in the next lesson, but since that's quite a different process from writing code, we've decided to go out of order and cover Web3.js first.

After you deploy your contract, it gets a fixed address on Ethereum where it will live forever. If you recall from Lesson 2, the address of the CryptoKitties contract on Ethereum mainnet is 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d.

You'll need to copy this address after deploying in order to talk to your smart contract.
Contract ABI

The other thing Web3.js will need to talk to your contract is its ABI.

ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. Basically it's a representation of your contracts' methods in JSON format that tells Web3.js how to format function calls in a way your contract will understand.

When you compile your contract to deploy to Ethereum (which we'll cover in Lesson 7), the Solidity compiler will give you the ABI, so you'll need to copy and save this in addition to the contract address.

Since we haven't covered deployment yet, for this lesson we've compiled the ABI for you and put it in a file named cryptozombies_abi.js, stored in variable called cryptoZombiesABI. Here is the code:

var cryptoZombiesABI = [

If we include cryptozombies_abi.js in our project, we'll be able to access the CryptoZombies ABI using that variable.
Instantiating a Web3.js Contract

Once you have your contract's address and ABI, you can instantiate it in Web3 as follows:

// Instantiate myContract
var myContract = new web3js.eth.Contract(myABI, myContractAddress);

Put it to the Test

    In the <head> of our document, include another script tag for cryptozombies_abi.js so we can import the ABI definition into our project.

    At the beginning of our <script> tag in the <body>, declare a var named cryptoZombies, but don't set it equal to anything. Later we'll use this variable to store our instantiated contract.

    Next, create a function named startApp(). We'll fill in the body in the next 2 steps.

    The first thing startApp() should do is declare a var named cryptoZombiesAddress and set it equal to the string "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" (this is the address of the CryptoZombies contract on mainnet).

    Lastly, let's instantiate our contract. Set cryptoZombies equal to an new web3js.eth.Contract like we did in the example code above. (Using cryptoZombiesABI, which gets imported with our script tag, and cryptoZombiesAddress from above).
```
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="cryptozombies_abi.js"></script>

   <script>
      var cryptoZombies;

      function startApp() {
        var cryptoZombiesAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
      cryptoZombies = new web3js.eth.Contract(cryptoZombiesABI, cryptoZombiesAddress);
}
```
## Chapter 4: Calling Contract Functions

Our contract is all set up! Now we can use Web3.js to talk to it.

Web3.js has two methods we will use to call functions on our contract: call and send.
Call

call is used for view and pure functions. It only runs on the local node, and won't create a transaction on the blockchain.

    Review: view and pure functions are read-only and don't change state on the blockchain. They also don't cost any gas, and the user won't be prompted to sign a transaction with MetaMask.

Using Web3.js, you would call a function named myMethod with the parameter 123 as follows:

myContract.methods.myMethod(123).call()

Send

send will create a transaction and change data on the blockchain. You'll need to use send for any functions that aren't view or pure.

    Note: sending a transaction will require the user to pay gas, and will pop up their Metamask to prompt them to sign a transaction. When we use Metamask as our web3 provider, this all happens automatically when we call send(), and we don't need to do anything special in our code. Pretty cool!

Using Web3.js, you would send a transaction calling a function named myMethod with the parameter 123 as follows:

myContract.methods.myMethod(123).send()

The syntax is almost identical to call().
Getting Zombie Data

Now let's look at a real example of using call to access data on our contract.

Recall that we made our array of zombies public:

Zombie[] public zombies;

In Solidity, when you declare a variable public, it automatically creates a public "getter" function with the same name. So if you wanted to look up the zombie with id 15, you would call it as if it were a function: zombies(15).

Here's how we would write a JavaScript function in our front-end that would take a zombie id, query our contract for that zombie, and return the result:

    Note: All the code examples we're using in this lesson are using version 1.0 of Web3.js, which uses promises instead of callbacks. Many other tutorials you'll see online are using an older version of Web3.js. The syntax changed a lot with version 1.0, so if you're copying code from other tutorials, make sure they're using the same version as you!

function getZombieDetails(id) {
  return cryptoZombies.methods.zombies(id).call()
}

// Call the function and do something with the result:
getZombieDetails(15)
.then(function(result) {
  console.log("Zombie 15: " + JSON.stringify(result));
});

Let's walk through what's happening here.

cryptoZombies.methods.zombies(id).call() will communicate with the Web3 provider node and tell it to return the zombie with index id from Zombie[] public zombies on our contract.

Note that this is asynchronous, like an API call to an external server. So Web3 returns a promise here. (If you're not familiar with JavaScript promises... Time to do some additional homework before continuing!)

Once the promise resolves (which means we got an answer back from the web3 provider), our example code continues with the then statement, which logs result to the console.

result will be a javascript object that looks like this:

{
  "name": "H4XF13LD MORRIS'S COOLER OLDER BROTHER",
  "dna": "1337133713371337",
  "level": "9999",
  "readyTime": "1522498671",
  "winCount": "999999999",
  "lossCount": "0" // Obviously.
}

We could then have some front-end logic to parse this object and display it in a meaningful way on the front-end.
Put it to the Test

  Create the getZombieDetails function as above into the code.

    Let's create a similar function for zombieToOwner. If you recall from ZombieFactory.sol, we had a mapping that looked like:

    mapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;

    Define a JavaScript function called zombieToOwner. Similar to getZombieDetails above, it will take an id as a parameter, and will return a Web3.js call to zombieToOwner on our contract.

    Below that, create a third function for getZombiesByOwner. If you recall from ZombieHelper.sol, the function definition looked like this:

    function getZombiesByOwner(address _owner)

    Our function getZombiesByOwner will take owner as a parameter, and return a Web3.js call to getZombiesByOwner.

function getZombieDetails(id) {
        return cryptoZombies.methods.zombies(id).call()
      }

function zombieToOwner(id) {
        return cryptoZombies.methods.zombieToOwner(id).call();
      }

function getZombiesByOwner(owner) {
        return cryptoZombies.methods.getZombiesByOwner(owner).call();
      }

## Chapter 5: Metamask & Accounts

Awesome! You've successfully written front-end code to interact with your first smart contract.

Now let's put some pieces together â€” let's say we want our app's homepage to display a user's entire zombie army.

Obviously we'd first need to use our function getZombiesByOwner(owner) to look up all the IDs of zombies the current user owns.

But our Solidity contract is expecting owner to be a Solidity address. How can we know the address of the user using our app?
Getting the user's account in MetaMask

MetaMask allows the user to manage multiple accounts in their extension.

We can see which account is currently active on the injected web3 variable via:

var userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0]

Because the user can switch the active account at any time in MetaMask, our app needs to monitor this variable to see if it has changed and update the UI accordingly. For example, if the user's homepage displays their zombie army, when they change their account in MetaMask, we'll want to update the page to show the zombie army for the new account they've selected.

We can do that with a setInterval loop as follows:

var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {
  // Check if account has changed
  if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== userAccount) {
    userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
    // Call some function to update the UI with the new account
    updateInterface();
  }
}, 100);

What this does is check every 100 milliseconds to see if userAccount is still equal web3.eth.accounts[0] (i.e. does the user still have that account active). If not, it reassigns userAccount to the currently active account, and calls a function to update the display.
Put it to the Test

Let's make it so our app will display the user's zombie army when the page first loads, and monitor the active account in MetaMask to refresh the display if it changes.

    Declare a var named userAccount in the second line of the script tag, but don't assign it to anything.

    At the end of startApp(), copy/paste the boilerplate accountInterval code from above

    Replace the line updateInterface(); with a call to getZombiesByOwner, and pass it userAccount

    Chain a then statement after getZombiesByOwner and pass the result to a function named displayZombies. (The syntax is: .then(displayZombies);).

    We don't have a function called displayZombies yet, but we'll implement it in the next chapter.


    var userAccount;

var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {
  // Check if account has changed
  if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== userAccount) {
    userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
    // Call some function to update the UI with the new account
    updateInterface();
  }
}, 100);

getZombiesByOwner(userAccount).then(displayZombies);


## Chapter 6: Displaying our Zombie Army

This tutorial wouldn't be complete if we didn't show you how to actually display the data you get back from the contract.

However, realistically, you'll want to use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js in your app, since they make your life a lot easier as a front-end developer. But covering React or Vue.js is way outside the scope of this tutorial â€” that would be an entire tutorial of multiple lessons in itself.

So in order to keep CryptoZombies.io focused on Ethereum and smart contracts, we're just going to show a quick example in JQuery to demonstrate how you could parse and display the data you get back from your smart contract.
Displaying zombie data â€” a rough example

Recall that in the previous chapter we called displayZombies from inside startApp() with the result of a call to getZombiesByOwner. It will be passed an array of zombie IDs that looks something like:

[0, 13, 47]

Thus we'll want our displayZombies function to:

    First clear the contents of the #zombies div, if there's anything already inside it. (This way if the user changes their active MetaMask account, it will clear their old zombie army before loading the new one).

    Loop through each id, and for each one call getZombieDetails(id) to look up all the information for that zombie from our smart contract, then

    Put the information about that zombie into an HTML template to format it for display, and append that template to the #zombies div.

Again, we're just using JQuery here, which doesn't have a templating engine by default, so this is going to be ugly. But here's a simple example of how we could output this data for each zombie:

// Look up zombie details from our contract. Returns a `zombie` object
getZombieDetails(id)
.then(function(zombie) {
  // Using ES6's "template literals" to inject variables into the HTML.
  // Append each one to our #zombies div
  $("#zombies").append(`<div class="zombie">
    <ul>
      <li>Name: ${zombie.name}</li>
      <li>DNA: ${zombie.dna}</li>
      <li>Level: ${zombie.level}</li>
      <li>Wins: ${zombie.winCount}</li>
      <li>Losses: ${zombie.lossCount}</li>
      <li>Ready Time: ${zombie.readyTime}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>`);
});

What about displaying the zombie sprites?

In the above example, we're simply displaying the DNA as a string. But in your DApp, you would want to convert this to images to display your zombie.

We did this by splitting up the DNA string into substrings, and having every 2 digits correspond to an image. Something like:

// Get an integer 1-7 that represents our zombie head:
var head = parseInt(zombie.dna.substring(0, 2)) % 7 + 1

// We have 7 head images with sequential filenames:
var headSrc = "../assets/zombieparts/head-" + head + ".png"

Each component is positioned with CSS using absolute positioning, to overlay it over the other images.

If you want to see our exact implementation, we've open sourced the Vue.js component we use for the zombie's appearance, which you can view here https://github.com/loomnetwork/zombie-char-component.

However, because there's a lot of code in that file, it's outside the scope of this tutorial. For this lesson, we'll stick with the extremely simple JQuery implementation above, and leave it to you to dive into a more beautiful implementation as homework ðŸ˜‰
Put it to the Test


  Create an empty <div id="zombies"></div> in the body of our document, as well as an empty displayZombies function.

    The first thing we'll want to do is empty the #zombies div. In JQuery, you can do this with $("#zombies").empty();.

    Next, we'll want to loop through all the ids, using a for loop: for (id of ids) {

    Inside the for loop, copy/paste the code block above that called getZombieDetails(id) for each id and then used $("#zombies").append(...) to add it to our HTML.


<div id="zombies"></div>

function displayZombies(ids) {
        
      }


    for (id of ids) {

    }
    

getZombieDetails(id)
.then(function(zombie) {
  // Using ES6's "template literals" to inject variables into the HTML.
  // Append each one to our #zombies div
  $("#zombies").append(`<div class="zombie">
    <ul>
      <li>Name: ${zombie.name}</li>
      <li>DNA: ${zombie.dna}</li>
      <li>Level: ${zombie.level}</li>
      <li>Wins: ${zombie.winCount}</li>
      <li>Losses: ${zombie.lossCount}</li>
      <li>Ready Time: ${zombie.readyTime}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>`);
});
